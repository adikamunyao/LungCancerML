# Lung Cancer Radiomics Analysis with Machine Learning


Welcome to the Lung Cancer Radiomics Analysis repository! This project focuses on leveraging radiomic features extracted from CT images to predict and understand non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The integration of radiomics and machine learning offers new perspectives for improving diagnosis and treatment strategies.


## Introduction
Lung cancer is a critical health challenge that demands innovative approaches for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. In this project, we delve into the analysis of radiomic features from CT images to unlock hidden insights within lung tumors, aiming to predict tumor behavior and improve clinical decision-making.

## Objectives
Explore radiomic features and their correlations with tumor behavior.
Develop machine learning models for differentiating benign and malignant lung tumors.
Provide a foundation for improved prognostication and personalized treatment strategies.

## Methodology
* Data Collection: Assemble a diverse dataset containing CT images of benign lung tumors and NSCLC cases.
* Feature Extraction: Quantify radiomic features such as texture, shape, and intensity from the CT images.
* Model Development: Employ machine learning algorithms to build predictive models based on radiomic features.
* Validation: Validate the models using cross-validation techniques and appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Results
* Reveal insights into radiomic patterns that correlate with tumor characteristics.
* Assess the accuracy of developed machine learning models in differentiating tumor types.
* Contribute to the understanding of NSCLC behavior and prognosis.
